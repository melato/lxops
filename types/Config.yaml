fields:
  ostype: |
    OS type determines how to run certain cloud-config sections, such as packages.
    Two ostypes are provided:
    - alpine, for alpine distributions.  Uses apk commands to add packages.
    - debian, for debian-based distributions.  Uses apt-get commands to add packages.
  
  image: The image name used for launching an instance.
  
  profiles: |
    The profiles that an instance will be launched with.
    An extra lxops profile will always be added.
  
  cloud-config-files: |
    A list of cloud-config files to apply to an instance when launching or rebuilding.
    The files can be specified using absolute paths or paths relative to the enclosing lxops file.
  
  include: |
    A list of lxops files to include.
    Include paths are either absolute or relative to the path of the including lxops file.
    The lxops files are merged in postorder traversal into a single lxops file.
    The included files are merged first, in the order that they were specified, and the 
     as follows:
    []string types are appended.  The field values of the parent lxops file are appended last.
    map types are merged in order in the natural way.  The parent lxops map entries are added last,
    overriding any previously set map keys.
    For single-valued fields a non-empty value from a later lxops file
  
  profile-pattern: |
    Specifies how the instance profile should be named.
    It defaults to "(instance).lxops"
  
  device-owner: |
    The owner (uid:gid) for new devices.
    Used to set the permissions of device directories that are created for the instance
    
  filesystems: |
    Filesystems are zfs filesystems or plain directories that are created
    when an instance is created.
    Devices are usually created inside filesystems.
    
    The keys in the filesystems map are used in the devices section
    to reference each filesystem.
  
  devices: |
    Devices are disk devices that are are attached to the instance.
    They added to the instance profile, which is attached to the instance.
  
  stop: |
    Stop the instance after configuring it.
    
  snapshot: |
    Create a snapshot of the instance after configuring it.
  
  properties: |
    A map of properties, used for property substitution.
    These properties override global properties,
    and properties from included files.
