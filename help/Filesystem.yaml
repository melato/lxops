fields:
  pattern: |
    A pattern that is used to derive the filesystem path on the host.
    Example: (fsroot)/log/(instance)  
    Filesystems should typically include the "instance" property,
    so that they are unique for each instance.  
    If the resulting path begins with "/", it is a plain directory.  
    If it does not begin with "/", it is a zfs filesystem.
  destroy: |
    Specifies that the filesystem should be destroyed by "lxops destroy".   
    This should be set to true in most cases.
    It is a safety feature to remind you that this filesystem may be destroyed by lxops.
  transient: |
    Marks a filesystem as transient.  
    Transient filesystems are not exported or imported and do not need to be backed up.  
    A device where a transient filesystem is appropriate is /tmp.
  zfsproperties: |
    A list of zfs properties to set when creating or cloning a zfs filesystem.
    They are passed to zfs using the -o flag.
