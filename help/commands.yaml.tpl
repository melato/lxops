short: manage {{.ServerType}} instances together with attached ZFS disk devices
long: |
  lxops launches {{.ServerType}} containers from config (lxops) files that 
  specify how the instance should be launched and configured.
  
  Goals:
  - launch instances from a config file
  - configure an instance, using cloud-config files
  - manage instance filesystems along with the instance
  - rebuild an instance from a new image, while preserving its filesystems and configuration

  Devices are attached to an instance via an instance profile.
  For documentation about the config file, run "lxops help config".
  
  Commands with summaries in parenthesis are auxiliary utilities.
  They may change without maintaining backward compatibility.

commands:
  configure:
    short: configure an existing instance
    use: <config-file> ...
    examples:
    - configure -name c1 demo.yaml
  image:
    short: (utilities for {{.ServerType}} instances)
    commands:
      export:
        short: export an image to split tarballs format
        long: |
          exports an image by calling {{.ServerType}} image export
          Then, convert it to rootfs.squashfs, metadata.tar.xz,
          so it can be used with simplestreams.
          See image convert.
      convert:
        short: convert unified image tarball to split tarballs
        use: "<file-or-directory>"
        long: |
          converts a unified .tar.gz image file into
          rootfs.squashfs, and metadata.tar.xz
          See https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/reference/image_format/#image-tarballs
          It does so by running the commands:
            sudo tar xvf {unified}.tar.gz
            sudo mksquashfs rootfs/ rootfs.squashfs -noappend -comp xz -b 1M
            tar Jcf metadata.tar.xz metadata.yaml templates/
          The argument can be either the path of the .tar.gz file or its parent directory.
          If it is a directory, it must contain a single .tar.gz file
          The image metadata can be modified by various flags
          If -parse is specified, the image metadata are determined by parsing
          the last component of the path (minus the .tar.gz suffix),
          using the format convention {variant}-{os}-{date}-{time}.
      simplestreams:
        short: (simplestreams commands)
        commands:
          add:
            short: incus-simplestreams add
            long: |
              This just calls "incus-simplestreams add",
              but first it changes the current directory to that specified
              by a flag, and converts the tarball and metadata arguments
              to absolute paths.
      instances:
        short: list image aliases for containers
        long: |
          print a table of all intances with columns:
          - image aliases
          - instance name
      metadata:
        short: manipulate image metadata.yaml
        commands:
          update:
            short: (modify image metadata.yaml)
            long: |
              updates a metadata.yaml image file
              Uses the provided name, the current time,
              and the existing values from metadata.yaml.
              Updates image name, description, variant, serial.
              Updates os, release, if they are provided.
  cloudconfig:
    short: apply cloud-config files to instances (new)
    use: "[instance]..."
    examples:
    - -ostype alpine -f myconfig.cfg mycontainer
    - -ostype debian mycontainer < myconfig.cfg
    long: |
      Uses the {{.ServerType}} API to apply the config to {{.ServerType}} instances.
      It does not lxops config files or properties.
      The following cloud-init modules (sections) are supported and applied in this order:
        - packages
        - write_files (defer: false)
        - users
        - runcmd
        - write_files (defer: true)
      See github.com/melato/cloudconfig.
      
      This command is marked as experimental, because it is new.
      It may turn out to be a core functionality of lxops.
  instance:
    short: ({{.ServerType}} instance utilities)
    commands:
      addresses:
        short: (export network addresses for all containers)
      cloudconfig:
        short: (applies cloud-config files to instances)

        examples:
        - -ostype alpine -i mycontainer -f config.cfg
        - -ostype alpine -i mycontainer < config.cfg
        - -ostype alpine -i mycontainer config.cfg...
        - -ostype alpine -f config.cfg instance...
        long: |
          configures {{.ServerType}} instances by applying cloud-init config to them,
          using the {{.ServerType}} API.
          Can either apply one cloud-init file to multiple instances
          or apply multiple cloud-init files to one instance.

          The following cloud-init modules (sections) are supported and applied in this order:
            - packages
            - write_files (defer: false)
            - users
            - runcmd

      This command creates filesystems and devices for the instance specified
      in the command line, it copies the files from the corresponding directories
      of the implied image, and shifts the uids and gids of by the amount
      specified by the device-owner property (uid:gid).ConfigVersion
      
      It works only for lxops configuration files that have an image property and
      use ZFS devices.
      
      It creates a container from this image,
      finds the container root filesystem origin,
      mounts this origin to a temporary directory, and copies the specified
      device directories from the image to the instance device directories.
  create:
    short: (create container from image)
    use: <config-file>
    long: |
      This is an experimental version of launch that does not start the container.
      Its original purpose was to extract devices from an image.

  rebuild:
    short: rebuild an instance
    use: <config-file> ...
    long: |
      Rebuild replaces the instance image with the one specified in the config file,
      preserving the instance configuration.
      It also applies the cloud-config files specified in the config file.
      The image will be left in the Running state.

      Uses ssh and zfs send/receive to copy a snapshot of the instance filesystems
      between hosts.
      If a short snapshot name is provided, it is used in the zfs send commands.
      Otherwise, a new snapshot is generated using "lxops snapshot".
      
      		[ssh <from-host>] lxops snapshot -s <generated-snapshot> ...

        , using the current date,
      and a snapshot is created in the source filesystems.
      
      Assumes that the config file is at the same path on the other host,
      and has the same filesystems.
