description:
fields:
  path: |
    The path of the device in the instance.
  
  filesystem: |
    The key of the filesystem that the device is in.
    If it is empty, the device dir should be an absolute path on the host.
  
  dir: |
    A subdirectory for the device in its filesystem.
    If dir is missing, it defaults to the key of the device in the devices map.  
    If dir is ".", the device host directory is the directory of the filesystem,
    so there is no sub-directory created.
    If the device has no filesystem, dir should be an absolute path on the host.
  
  readonly: |
    The device readonly flag.  If true, the device is mounted readonly.
    This is useful for devices without a filesystem.
