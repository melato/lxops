  Pattern is a string that goes through property substitution.
  Any parenthesized expression in a pattern is substituted by the
  value of the property with the name inside the parenthesis.
  
  Properties are specified in several places:
  User properties are stored in the file lxops/properties.yaml,
  in the user's config directory, usually ~/.config/.
  They can be managed by the "lxops property" commands, or edited manually.
  
  config properties are specified in the lxops config files,
  in the properties field.
  
  command-line properties are specified in the lxops command line.
  
  Built-in properties:
  instance: The name of the instance.


  Filesystem example:
  If you want each instance to have a ZFS filesystem in tank/host, then:
  Set a user property "fshost" for "tank/host":
    lxops property set fshost tank/host
  Set the pattern field in the filesystem:
    filesystems:
      host:
        pattern: (fshost)/(instance)
        
  When instance "a" is created with this config file,
  it will have the filesystem: tank/host/a
  
  Image example:
  If you use the latest alpine image in your lxops config files,
  you can put the name of the image in a property:
    lxops property set alpine-image images:alpine/3.18
  
  Use it in the config files:
    image: (alpine-image)

  When you upgrade to the next alpine image, when it comes out, you can
  change the value of the alpine-image property,
  without changing the config files.
    
  You can also do this with custom images that you use for your instances.
  When you update the image, give it a new name,
  and set the image property to the new name.
